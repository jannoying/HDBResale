# HDB Resale Data Analysis

## Project Overview 
Getting a HDB is probably one of the biggest financial decisions many Singaporeans have to make, given its exhorbitant cost. Making a wrong decision could set you back several years in terms of opportunity cost & time value of money.
In this project, we seek to build data visualisation to shed light on the HDB resale market, and provide key consideration parameters to help us make better decisions in choosing a:

(1) HDB Resale flat, or\
(2) BTO flats that are likely to appreciate in the resale market

## Features
1. **Data Import and Preprocessing**: Seamlessly imported data from CSV files using Pandas. Performed data preprocessing tasks like cleaning, filtering, and transforming the data to prepare it for visualization.
  
2. **Multiple Chart Types**: Leveraged the extensive capabilities of Matplotlib to create a wide range of static visualizations. Ranging from line charts, bar charts, subplots, boxplots, and more to represent different data patterns and relationships.

3. **Geospatial Visualization**: Utilize Folium to create interactive maps and geospatial visualizations with adjustable zoom levels.

4. **Statistical Analysis**: Utilised Pandas for statistical computations and data manipulation. Performed calculations like mean, median, standard deviation to derive insights and support visual findings.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the following individuals and resources for their invaluable contributions and support throughout the development of this data visualization project:

1. **Min Yan**: The lead instructor for the AI100 August 2020 Cohort for providing expert guidance and valuable insights on data visualization techniques, which significantly enhanced the project's quality.
